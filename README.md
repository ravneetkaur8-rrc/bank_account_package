# BankAccount Package

This project simulates various types of bank accounts, including `ChequingAccount`, `SavingsAccount`, and `InvestmentAccount`, each inheriting from the `BankAccount` base class.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism was achieved in this project through the use of the `get_service_charges()` method. Each subclass (`ChequingAccount`, `SavingsAccount`, `InvestmentAccount`) overrides this method to calculate service charges based on its specific requirements.

## Running the Program

To run the program, execute the `A02_main.py` file. It will create instances of each account type, perform deposits, withdrawals, and print the results along with service charges.
